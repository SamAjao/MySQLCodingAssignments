"# MySQLCodingAssignments" 

DESCRIPTION:
This is a menu-driven application that demonstrates how to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) operations on a project database. Thus far, we have learned how to create a connection to a MySQL database and how to insert records into a table. Then, we learned how to query for a list of records and for all details on a single record. Finally, we implemented the final two parts of CRUD: Updating and Deleting.

TECHNOLOGIES USED:
MySQL
MYSQL Workbench
Java
JDBC
